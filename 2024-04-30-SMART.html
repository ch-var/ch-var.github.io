<p align='justify'>In summary, <b>SMART</b> (<b>S</b>pectral energy distributions <b>M</b>arkov chain <b>A</b>nalysis with <b>R</b>adiative <b>T</b>ransfer models) is a publicly available open-source spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code. Implementing a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, <b>SMART</b> fits the ultraviolet to millimetre SEDs of galaxies exclusively with radiative transfer models that currently constitute four types of pre-computed libraries, which describe the starburst, active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, host galaxy and polar dust components. <b>SMART</b> promises to be a useful tool for studying galaxy evolution in the <i>JWST</i> era. For more details, as well as applications of <b>SMART</b>, please read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1141">article</a>. The code is available on the <a href="https://www.ascl.net/2406.003">Astrophysics Source Code Library</a> (ASCL) or on <a href="https://github.com/ch-var/SMART">GitHub</a>.
