<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: -50px; margin-right: -50px;">My name is <b>Charalambia Varnava</b> and I am a passionate <b>researcher</b>, blending <b>computational and applied mathematics</b>, as well as <b>galaxy evolution</b>. My research has led to publications in prestigious journals, as well as international 
press releases.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>

<p align='justify'>The last years I worked as a Researcher at Aristarchus Research Center of European University Cyprus. I also worked as a Scientific Collaborator at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of European University Cyprus, being an instructor for Statistics I and Business Statistics. I previously worked as a Post-Graduate Researcher at the In-Silico Modelling Group of the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering of the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I received my Ph.D. in 2024 from European University Cyprus, with my thesis titled “A Bayesian method for fitting spectral energy distributions of galaxies with radiative transfer models”. Prior to my doctorate, I was ranked the best M.Sc. student in the 2015 Applied Mathematics cohort at the University of Cyprus. My M.Sc. thesis is titled “Robust exponential convergence in a balanced norm for an <i>hp</i> finite element method applied to fourth order singularly perturbed problems”. I also hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics awarded by the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I was a recipient of several awards, including a full scholarship for the Ph.D. Program of Computing/Computer Science granted by European University Cyprus, the award of highest academic record during the Master’s degree program in Applied Mathematics granted by the Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences of the University of Cyprus and the Sievert Larsson/Ancoria Excellence Award of highest academic record during the Master’s degree program in Applied Mathematics granted by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I participated in the research projects “Further development of CYprus models for Galaxies and their NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS+)”, which was a European Space Agency (ESA) award, “CYprus models for Galaxies and their NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS)”, which was also an ESA award, and “In-silico modelling”, which was a University of Cyprus internal research program.</a>

<p align='justify'>My doctoral studies pioneered the development of a novel open-source tool named “<b>SMART</b> (<b>S</b>pectral energy distributions <b>M</b>arkov chain <b>A</b>nalysis with <b>R</b>adiative <b>T</b>ransfer models)”. <b>SMART</b> implements a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the ultraviolet to millimetre spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies exclusively with radiative transfer models. For more details, as well as applications of <b>SMART</b>, please read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1141">article</a>. The code is available on the <a href="https://www.ascl.net/2406.003">Astrophysics Source Code Library</a> (ASCL) or on <a href="https://github.com/ch-var/SMART">GitHub</a>.</p>
