<p align='justify'>My name is <b>Charalambia Varnava</b> and I am a passionate <b>postdoctoral researcher</b>, leveraging <b>computational and applied mathematics</b> to address challenges across astrophysics, data-driven sciences and beyond. My work has been published in prestigious journals and has received international recognition through global media coverage.</p>

<p style="font-family: var(--header-font); font-weight: 800; line-height: 1.1; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.25rem;">About me</p>

<p align='justify'>I received my Ph.D. from European University Cyprus in 2024, with a thesis titled “A Bayesian method for fitting spectral energy distributions of galaxies with radiative transfer models”. Prior to my doctorate, I was recognized as the top M.Sc. student in the 2015 Applied Mathematics cohort at the University of Cyprus. My M.Sc. thesis is titled “Robust exponential convergence in a balanced norm for an <i>hp</i> finite element method applied to fourth order singularly perturbed problems”. I also hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I have been honored with several awards and scholarships, including a full academic scholarship for the Ph.D. program in Computing/Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering jointly with the Aristarchus Research Center of European University Cyprus. Additionally, I received two awards for achieving the highest average grade during my Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics: one from the Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences at the University of Cyprus, and the Sievert Larsson/Ancoria Excellence Award from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the same university.</p>

<p align='justify'>I participated in the research projects “Further development of CYprus models for Galaxies and their NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS+)” and “CYprus models for Galaxies and their NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS)”, both funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). I was also involved in “In-silico modelling”, an internal research program at the University of Cyprus. Additionally, I am a founding member of Women in Mathematical Sciences in Cyprus (WMSC).</a>

<p align='justify'>My doctoral studies pioneered the development of a novel open-source PYTHON-based tool named “<b>SMART</b> (<b>S</b>pectral energy distribuions <b>M</b>arkov chain <b>A</b>nalysis with <b>R</b>adiative <b>T</b>ransfer models)”. <b>SMART</b> implements a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the ultraviolet to millimetre spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies exclusively with radiative transfer models. For further details, please read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1141">article</a>. The code is available on the <a href="https://www.ascl.net/2406.003">Astrophysics Source Code Library</a> (ASCL) or on <a href="https://github.com/ch-var/SMART">GitHub</a>. According to Oxford University Press, the article describing <b>SMART</b> was listed amongst the most-read recent articles in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p>
