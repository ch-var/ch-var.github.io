<p style="font-family: var(--header-font); font-weight: 800; line-height: 1.1; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1.25rem;">About me</p>

<p align='justify'>I hold a PhD in Computing/Computer Science from European University Cyprus, with a thesis titled “A Bayesian method for fitting spectral energy distributions of galaxies with radiative transfer models”. Prior to my doctorate, I was recognized as the top MSc student in the 2015 Applied Mathematics cohort at the University of Cyprus. My MSc thesis is titled “Robust exponential convergence in a balanced norm for an <i>hp</i> finite element method applied to fourth order singularly perturbed problems”. I also hold a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I have been honored with several awards and scholarships, including a full academic scholarship for the PhD program in Computing/Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering jointly with the Aristarchus Research Center of European University Cyprus. Additionally, I received two awards for achieving the highest average grade during my Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics: one from the Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences at the University of Cyprus, and the Sievert Larsson/Ancoria Excellence Award from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the same university.</p>
