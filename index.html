<p align='justify'>My name is <b>Charalambia Varnava</b> and I am a passionate <b>researcher</b> in the broad areas of <b>computational and applied mathematics</b>, as well as <b>galaxy evolution</b>. My research work has led to publications in prestigious journals, as well as international 
press releases.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>

<p align='justify'>I am a Researcher at Aristarchus Research Center of European University Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I previously worked as a Scientific Collaborator at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of European University Cyprus, being an instructor for Statistics I and Business Statistics. I also worked as a Post-Graduate Researcher at the In-Silico Modelling Group of the Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering of the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I hold a Ph.D. in Computing/Computer Science awarded by European University Cyprus. My Ph.D. thesis’ title is “A Bayesian method for fitting spectral energy distributions of galaxies with radiative transfer models”. I was ranked the best M.Sc. student in the 2015 Applied Mathematics cohort at the University of Cyprus. My M.Sc. thesis’ title is “Robust exponential convergence in a balanced norm for an hp finite element method applied to fourth order singularly perturbed problems”. I also hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics awarded by the University of Cyprus.</p>

<p align='justify'>I was a recipient of several awards, including a full scholarship for the Ph.D. Program of Computing/Computer Science granted by European University Cyprus, the award of highest academic record and the Sievert Larsson/Ancoria Excellence Award of highest academic record during the Master’s degree program in Applied Mathematics granted by the Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Cyprus, respectively.</p>

<p align='justify'>I am currently participating in the project “Further development of CYprus models for Galaxies and their NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS+)”, which is a European Space Agency (ESA) award. Before, I have been a member of the project “CYprus models for Galaxies and their NUclear Spectra (CYGNUS)”, which was also an ESA award, and of “In-silico tumouroid growth”, which was a University of Cyprus internal research program.</a>

<p align='justify'>Within my Ph.D. project I developed an open-source tool named “<b>SMART</b> (<b>S</b>pectral energy distributions <b>M</b>arkov chain <b>A</b>nalysis with <b>R</b>adiative <b>T</b>ransfer models)”. <b>SMART</b> implements a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the ultraviolet to millimetre spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies exclusively with radiative transfer models. For more details, as well as applications of <b>SMART</b>, please read the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1141">article</a>. The code is available on the <a href="https://www.ascl.net/2406.003">Astrophysics Source Code Library</a> (ASCL) or on <a href="https://github.com/ch-var/SMART">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p align='justify'>I am a founding member of Women in Mathematical Sciences in Cyprus (WMSC).</p>

<p align='justify'>My research interests span across several disciplines in theoretical and applied science, more specifically in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Computational mathematics</li>

<li>MCMC model fitting</li>

<li>Bayesian inference</li>

<li>Differential equations</li>

<li>SED fitting</li>

<li>Finite element method</li>
</ul>
